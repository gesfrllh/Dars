    "I'm Frontend Developer who loves coffee, I started liking programming when I was on the internet and I accidentally opened a console element, and I started asking myself, what does this code mean?, and I started looking for answers. From then on I liked programming, my experience in the world of programming was 3 years, and in professional programming it was 1 year, if you are interested in me you can download my cv or you can send a message to me via the input form at contact. Thanks.",
